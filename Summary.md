0:00:00 What up guys, Jack here, Grace here, I run Persist, Grace is running Bloom, right now called Bloom Scroll, with us.
0:00:13 We are always looking for standout talent in all categories. Today we're talking about the web developer category. And how we do our hirings here at Persist is we make it very simple.
0:00:28 We say, look, It doesn't matter where you went to school, anything about you, what matters is can you take an idea and can you do it with excellence.
0:00:43 In fact, we're going to help direct you towards excellence by talking about and showing some of the best websites, historically, to try to give this assignment with the scope of not limiting your potential.
0:00:58 So, insane, let's create one. One of the most cool websites in the world. That's the goal. I did this before and I believe I have one of the cooler websites in the world, uhm, from a guy named Piyush, my first hire ever.
0:01:14 So, he's now just gone on and, uh, done amazing, amazing things. So we're going to pull up first some examples here.
0:01:26 I will say the plan here is, You'll get a $1,000 bonus if we select you, uhm, then you'll get 12 LPA, uh, and then, also, you'll be part of our web dev studio, so when you do projects for clients, uhm, you'll, you can see, like, our advisory team is, is super stacked, our mentor network is stacked.
0:01:53 so we have all this like network which currently we're bottlenecked on all of the persists web pages but once we have a surplus web dev talent, we'll go out and we'll say, hey, who needs a website, and then we'll share in the profits with you.
0:02:09 I like to get people who are also somewhat entrepreneurial, who want to elevate themselves to the highest degree. It goes hand in hand with the idea of building the best website in the world, right?
0:02:17 So let's go look at some of those great websites, why don't we, Grace? Let's do it. Now, what do you like about this?
0:02:24 I like how it draws me in. The glow. And how you can scroll in. Look at this. Super cool. Dimensional.
0:02:36 Whole experience. And now it actually tells me a little bit about the product. Yep, now that I'm drawn in. Started with a little engagement.
0:02:46 You clearly, you build a lot of trust, because you see just how much unique and different it is as a product.
0:02:55 But not too abstract. You can still understand what they're trying to do. Yep. Who they are. All the spaces. Look, it keeps going.
0:03:03 Look how they visualize this. Just well done. Very. And then a call to action at the end. So, I think they took, like, just awesome design and paired it up with storytelling in a magical, magical way.
0:03:24 If you're someone who sees this You'll probably have no one probably who's watching this has ever been like the website like this.
0:03:33 Umm, you've also never been asked to. In life, uh, the people who are in the top percent of their skill base are the ones who level up and win and become the most successful.
0:03:46 And anyone can get there as long as you just basically study the greats and then say, what is the difference between me and the great?
0:03:56 So this might take, it should be the longest you've ever spent on building a website. . . If you're actually taking time and care to compose, like, the best, uh, musical artists in the world, you know, they say, I am not gonna take mediocre for an answer.
0:04:12 I'm gonna build something different. Um, so first we're just gonna go through a bunch of these websites which are built different.
0:04:20 Then we're gonna go and we're gonna say, the actual, um, well, I think we can talk a little bit about it now because I'm just really excited about it, Grace.
0:04:29 About blue. Because I think, uh, I think it adds an element to the people watching this to understand that they're gonna be working on a really cool website, uh, and kinda displaying their capabilities with one of the coolest concepts in the world, one of the most important concepts in the world.
0:04:51 I say that without exaggeration. I'd actually say it is the most important subject and conversation in the world of what Bloom is going after.
0:05:00 Thank you. So, why don't you? So everyone here has probably spent a good amount of time on social media. Our goal is to reinvent social media for good, to be run on an empowerment algorithm so that you all are inspired by your time on social media rather than, Currently it uses engagement algorithm, 
0:05:23 which means maximize value stolen from you. Yeah, you're getting time extracted away from you. Rather than maximizing, What videos are fed to you for good?
0:05:35 So many of you have probably heard the term, or you will hear the term, doomscrolling. Uh, which is why the, the actual website URL is bloomscroll.com for this bloom app.
0:05:48 Um, and, you know, why, why can't you pick up your phone and just get charged, activated, feel the spirit of the world?
0:06:01 We've never built a feed that optimizes for that. And so, there's obviously a really deep, um, powerful capability to display, I think, the depth of how that transforms the world.
0:06:19 Uh, what's, what's coming to mind for me is when we were pulling up these websites, we found this one, um, which is cool.
0:06:31 Uuuuh, oooooh, ooooh, oooooh.
0:06:43 I was gonna be doing, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh. Oh. That's a great way to do a .
0:07:01 . The thing that, that comes to my imagination with, with how do you, how do we display this art? Um. And by the way, I want to preface this and frame this with, this is ultimate creative freedom.
0:07:16 Um. In fact, that's part of the test, is I want to see how much is it possible for you to, like, go take a concept and actually be a creative artist.
0:07:31 As well as a web developer, which includes being, like, a designer. We're looking for someone to create an experience that captures bloom.
0:07:39 Rather than use what we're showing you. Right. And so with any of these websites, it shouldn't try at all to be a carbon copy.
0:07:47 Uh. Anything you've seen. And from what I'm saying, um. And from what I'm saying is my idea, you don't even need to use it.
0:07:59 I'm just planting it. I'm just planting seed. 8 8 So the idea that I have in visualizing how bloom is just such an important concept is that we live in a world that's currently the doomscroll, um, which is like humanity itself is an organism.
0:08:20 Um. And the doomscroll is a tumor which is extracting or pulling resources from the entire body. It's a de-evolution.
0:08:31 of humanity. And, um, when we- when we bloomscroll, um, it is the body activating and getting more whole and healthy and empowered, uh, individual body and the collective body.
0:08:53 Yeah. And the- I would say, uhh, ooh, have I read this one? Yeah, I have.
0:09:07 I guess it's just coming back up hardcore. This is one of my favorite writers. Um, I think there's something to be said for turning his stuff into, uhh, Well, yeah, but just this art form.
0:09:29 It's like a scrollable interactive page more or less. Wait, but why? Neuralink, I think has a decent design showcasing the consciousness of, yeah.
0:09:53 Okay. Humans, networks, the human network, uh, the computer network.
0:10:27 This is like such a good article for them. Dense with information. Umm, not helpful for more of this story.
0:10:38 I was thinking there was some good, uh, some animation with a body like this with, like, extraction.
0:10:53 Or, we're in a more abstract way, I guess. So, again, you might be feeling a little bit like, wow, this is a project.
0:11:11 It is. Umm, and I realize that. And, I'm gonna up the bonus, the initial bonus to $2,000. Because, uh, it's gonna push you to your limit.
0:11:27 You might need to contact a friend to help you with something. Umm, like, creating a, creating a really good website that helps explain bloom, which we're gonna link some, like, articles on that Grace wrote.
0:11:38 Which, again, are just, like, awesome articles in general, and your design website for one of the most important purposes in mankind.
0:11:45 So, it should align all of your chakra system. Umm. Umm. And it will get so many views. This one's not cool enough.
0:11:54 This website, not cool enough. But, yeah, when you build websites like these, uh, actually, like, on, The X. I found this because people were just tweeting on how cool the website is.
0:12:14 It's similar to, like, content, like, but people put so much time into making really great videos. People don't think, oh, I'm gonna make the coolest website ever.
0:12:23 Umm.
0:12:38 Daybreak Studio. Let's see, we made it. Oh, wow. They didn't use any stock. That was, like, something they filmed. But you can use stock.
0:12:58 Good luck. Anyways, now it's just a constant, like, people are, like, wow. This could be the Bloom website. Bloomscroll.com. Bloom.com, make it big.
0:13:25 Eventually Bloom.com. Woo! It's just another, uh, cool website for Greta. In general, as a life advice as a web dev, just learn to make the coolest websites in the world, and you will have the best life in the world.
0:13:52 Umm. I will be able to charge much more from other people. for the frontage type. So the, the, the bonuses that I'm working with clients in my network will be much bigger than the 2000 I've been offering.
0:14:13 Umm. Which I'm straight into my business news. Actually, I haven't checked out this site. Umm, I actually don't like it.
0:14:24 It's boring. It's flat. Flat. We want dimensional. Yeah, so some of these I was just clicking on Reddit, like, uhh, uhh, uhh, .
0:14:33 Best websites, and. I haven't even tried it. I think it's cool.
0:14:54 I will save her bloom. We are actually really looking for, umm, a scrolling experience. Yeah. . . A unique scrolling experience. Yeah.
0:15:05 Because it is bloom scroll, umm, definitely like the idea of, a flower blooming and like, the right text along the way.
0:15:15 And dimensional scroll, like this. That takes you on a journey. That one's actually my website, I mean, web dev studio.
0:15:47 I used to run for getting more into startups. And, umm, it was made by P.S. from India. First hire ever.
0:15:57 Uh, he only made, uh, $300 a month. Yeah. Yeah. We'll a few minutes. Okay. Bye. Found each other on a, uh, on a forum.
0:16:06 Wow. Did it an incredible job? No. So whoever makes the blue website, you're gonna make sure you show it to some of the wealthiest people in the world and just get our web dev follow on clients so they get rich too, right?
0:16:32 Yep. No problem. It's a cool. I mean, it's part of our fund raise. The key of having an amazing website is to help us raise funds.
0:16:40 And we're gonna be raising funds from some incredible people. And they're gonna be like, who did your website? So this is one of the biggest hacks, um, to get into.
0:16:50 Mmm. I will show, uh, three different billionaires. There's not that many billionaires in the world. Um, I will show three of them, this website, for sure.
0:17:09 So, it's your chance to sit behind that computer screen and extract millions of dollars from it just by clicking the right buttons.
0:17:17 Entering the right timeline and the right dimension. Um, cool. Final words? Help us make an incredibly unique experience so that people really understand the core of what we're doing.
0:17:32 We're gonna share more- more about Bloom, more about the mission, and please think outside of the box incredibly creatively about how to bring the vision to life and give people an experience that gets them really curious about what's coming.
0:17:45 So, you're gonna see in the, uh, summary of the Loom Link here, some links, uh, if you go down here to the new stuff, and by the way, .
0:18:03 . . We've done these processes a lot for people to try to build startups, and I just wanted to show, like, there's a lot of these success stories where the people were, like, I was just excited, I really didn't know if I could do it, and I just spent the next two weeks, like, figuring it out, and just
0:18:21 , like, elevating myself more than I ever have, and so all of these people have been selected through this process to actually run different companies.
0:18:31 Um, so . . . You'll effectively be, be coming on to run the, uh, the web development agency, or at least be a lead designer there.
