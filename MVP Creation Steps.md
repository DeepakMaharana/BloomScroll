How I build MVPs superfast using awesome AI tools and prompts:

My 2024 workflow with step by step process to go from idea to launching the product üëá


1/ I start with a brief project outline üìù
Before jumping into the code, first I get crystal clear on the vision of the project:
- What's the product ? Web app / Mobile app or something else
- What's the end value and benefits of the product in 2 lines for the users.
- Who is it for ? Audience definition.
- What problems would it solve ? What's the main goal of it ?

Example: I am building Nomadsfuel, an app connects with like minded travellers and helps people to host and launch their own group trip

The clear the requirements, brief and goals, the smoother the ride.

2/ Generate features using ChatGPT/Claude
Now, I turn that brief/requirements into actionable features.
I prompt it with :
"Here's the project requirements brief: (Insert brief). Generate a list of actionable key features and technical requirements for building this mobile/web app MVP

For Nomadsfuel, we would like to have
- Group hosting trips from users
- User dashboard with their trips from around
- Timeline to interact with like minded travellers "

This is a crucial step and blueprint for success

3/ Mapping out the pages and structure üó∫Ô∏è
With features in hand, I ask ChatGPT/Claude to outline the MVP's screens:
"Based on the this project idea requirements and its features, list all the pages/screens required to build this product. "

For Nomadsfuel we get:
- Landing page
- Login/Signup
- User Profile
- Timeline
- Booking group trips page

Now we have a cool roadmap to follow.

4/ Building the homepage using Lovable/Bolt üíª
I take this application structure to lovable for further improvement and generating the base code.
I add the whole requirements brief and structure into it in the prompt
"Here's the project brief: (Insert brief). Use this application structure (Insert structure generated in previous step) to generate a clean, responsive,  minimal and aesthetic design."

It crafts the UI code from the descriptions. 
Start with the homepage,
It's the product's first impression.
Review , Refine & Repeat

5/ Spend some time perfecting the Landing page.
The landing page is your MVP's handshake. 
I ensure it's perfect:
Lovable/Bolt lets you tweak components easily.
I prompt for improvements and keep on refining until it's spot on and looks aesthetically pleasing to me.

Iterate until the vibe is just right‚Äîthis sets the tone for everything else.

6/ Using the same workflow for other pages üîÉ
I replicate this for all the pages and components:
- Using ChatGPT/Claude to define each of the page's structure.
- Lovable/Bolt generates the UI.
- Refining with simple prompts.

Example - "Reducing margins , add some padding to a component, aligning buttons etc"

Keep on iterating until it looks how I want.

7/ Connect Supabase using Lovable
Lovable is the best when using database stuff in development and handling backend integrations.

Sometimes, I use lovable to directly setup the backend using Supabase and use Authentication and Database stuff easily. It simplifies the backend stuff very much.
I deploy the minimal version directly from lovable to collect and gather the feedback from clients, testing the main features and functionalities and validating the idea.

But most of the times in the next step, before deploying and testing for feedback, I use my own boilerplate code to add all the production ready predefined features and functionalities into it, as first impression is the last impression.
Setting up the,
- Authentication
- Database
- Payments
- Emails
etc

8/ Take it to cursor/windsurf for advanced development ‚öíÔ∏è
Lovable syncs with Github, I move to cursor or windsurf for the main development part of it.
All the complex logic part , I refine it in cursor IDE for dealing with all the heavy lifting of the project.

I also hop back and forth in lovable for adding some quick integrations.

9/ Tools recap üìù
- ChatGPT/Claude for planning and features brainstorming
- Lovable/Bolt for MVP generation, deployment, feedback, quick integrations
- Cursor or Windsurf for advanced development.

10/ Final Thoughts üí≠
This workflow has been the most productive for me and has completely changed the game of building MVP development for me.

It's efficient, saves hours, gets the idea from brain to real life faster than ever.
